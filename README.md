# SAP XML Generator
A simple application that can generate an XML input for Elmhurst Design SAP 10 from a standardised Excel sheet.

Download from [here](https://github.com/HoareLea/SAP_XML_Generator/releases/tag/v0.2). Once donwloaded, unzip the folder.

The zip contains the following:
- build
- dist
- CALC-XX-XX-SAP CALC TEMPLATE.xlsx

To use this tool, do the following.
1. Move the unzipped folder to a safe location. You can move the folder to Documents for example.
2. The dist folder contains an executable (sap_xml_generator.exe) that runs the app. You can make a shortcut to the executable and move the shortcut somewhere with easy access (e.g. Desktop).
3. Run the sap_xml_gen.exe file, or run the shortcut if you have made one.
4. The app will ask to select the pre-filled CALC-XX-XX-SAP CALC TEMPLATE.xlsx.
5. Finally, the app will ask to select an export folder.
6. The app will generate the XML assessments and dump them in the export folder you have selected.
